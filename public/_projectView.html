          <h2 class="featurette-heading">RecordKeeper. <span class="text-muted"> Social Network for Record Collectors.</span></h2>
            <p>The purpose of the application is to allow users to keep track of their growing record collections. Users can also see what albums have been uploaded and check out other users music collections. It was a collaborative project built on Ruby on Rails Framework and library. We utilized Postgresql for our database.Sorcery gem for user authentication and sessions</p>
            <p> My contribution was getting album forms to post to the database and and creating user profile pages showing all of their uploaded content. I made sure users only had access to their content and could not delete/edit other user's data. I also confirmed all routes functioned properly and routed to correct locations.  </p>

             <p>The purpose of this application is to be a concert ticket scrapbook. As someone who loves going to shows and holding on to tickets, I wanted some way to keep them all safe.</p>
             <p> I built this application using MeteorJs framework. I picked Meteor because I want to learn about different frameworks and how they vary in structure and their best uses. I wanted this be to a mobile application and when compiled into xcode, it allows access to user's camera and photo library to snap a picture of their tickets. </p>

             <p>This application had a different take on services like tripadvisor. It allows hotel personnel to create accounts and share reviews about guests. It was a collaborative application built using Node.Js, Express and MongoDB. Passport was used to control user sessions. </p>
             <p>My contribution entailed creating Ajax calls to guest collection in our API for autocomplete search functionality. I set up database schema using Mongolab and ensured everyone had access to data. I was in charge of deploying application to Heroku and troubleshooted and resolved issues that arose during deployment.</p>
