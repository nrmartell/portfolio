          <p>The purpose of the application is to allow users to keep track of their growing record collections. Users can also see what albums have been uploaded and check out other users music collections. It was a collaborative project built in Ruby on Rails Framework and library. We utilized Postgresql for database mangagement and sorcery gem for user authentication and sessions. My contribution was getting album forms to post to the database and ensuring users only had access to their uploaded content as well as confirming all routes were functioning properly.  </p>

          <p>This application had a different take on services like tripadvisor. It allows hotel personnel to create accounts and share reviews about guests. It was a collaborative application built using Node.Js, Express and MongoDB. Passport was used to control user sessions.My contribution entailed creating Ajax calls to guest collection in our API for autocomplete search functionality and setting up database schema. I also was in charge of deploying application to Heroku and resolved issues that arose during deployment.  </p>

          <p>The purpose of this application is to be a concert ticket scrapbook. As someone who loves going to shows and holding on to tickets, I wanted some way to keep them safe.I built this application from scratch using MeteorJs. This version allows users to fill out a form to upload their tickets. Version 2 is mobile and when compiled into xcode allows access to user's iphone camera and photo library. </p>
