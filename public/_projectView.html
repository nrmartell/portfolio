          <p>The purpose of the application is to allow users to keep track of their growing record collections. Users can also see what albums have been uploaded and check out other users music collections. It was a collaborative project built in Ruby on Rails Framework and library. We utilized Postgresql for database mangagement and sorcery gem for user authentication and sessions. My contribution was getting album forms to post to the database and ensuring users only had access to their uploaded content as well as confirming all routes were functioning properly.  </p>
