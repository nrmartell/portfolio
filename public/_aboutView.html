    			<p>Hello There! Thanks for stopping by my page.My name is Natalie.I'm a music lover, coder, tech enthusiast, and sometimes guitar player.</p>
          <p> I've always been interested in technology and how it impacts our lives on a daily basis. I love to back kickstarter campaigns and to be a part of people's amazing innovations. I admire people who are passionate about what they're doing and what they're building.
          <a href="/#/contact">Tell me what you're passionate about.</a></p>
          <p>I started to teach myself programming a little over a year ago. After realizing how much I liked it, I decided to attend an immersive course to grow my skill set. I really enjoyed the course and had so much fun, even when I was frustrated. I knew I had finally found something I loved doing. So have a look around. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
