			<p>Hello There! Thanks for wandering by my page. My name is Natalie. I'm a born and raised Texan, hailing from the great city of El Paso. I'm a music lover, tech enthusiast, guitar player, and a car singer.I've always been interested in technology and how it intersects with our lives on a daily basis. I took a gamble and headed out to Austin to take the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. I was ready for a career change and want to join a passionate team who believe in what they're doing and what they're building.</p>
